Coastal Data System - Waves (Mooloolaba) 01-2017 to 06 - 2019.csv

Wave monitoring buoys are used for collecting the data. Wave monitoring buoys continuously measures the wave height, wave period and wave direction.
As the wave monitoring buoy floats up and down each passing wave, its motion is measured and electronically processed. Data from the wave monitoring buoys are transmitted to a nearby receiver station as a radio signal.
Measured and derived wave data in this study is collected by oceanographic wave measuring buoys anchored at Mooloolaba/Queensland/Australia.
